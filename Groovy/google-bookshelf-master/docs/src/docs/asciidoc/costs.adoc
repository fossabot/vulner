=== Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Cloud Platform including Google Compute Engine.

This tutorial has several steps, and each step is documented on its own page. The final page of the tutorial includes
instructions for cleaning up resources, so you won't continue to be billed for Cloud Platform services.
If you decide not to complete all the steps of the tutorial, see the link:index.html#_cleaning_up[cleanup instructions] on the final page.
