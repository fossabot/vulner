When we upload a book cover image several things will happen:

- The cover image is uploaded to Google https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Cloud Storage]. This will provided use with an image url which
we will store in the database `book` table row.
- Text in the cover image is extracted by Google https://cloud.google.com/vision/[Cloud Vision API].
- A book entry in a MySQL database provided by Google https://cloud.google.com/sql/[Cloud SQL].
- Prior to saving or updating a book, the English title and description are translated to Spanish and Italian with Google https://cloud.google.com/translate/[Cloud Translation API]. Those
translations are saved to the database.
