This is done through a combination of the SPL configuration directives named 'checkpointing' and 'restartable'. Developers can protect their critical operator data by taking advantage of this built-in checkpointing feature. When you run this example, you will see data flows without any gaps or interruption, when a PE is killed manually and then gets restored automatically by the Streams runtime."}
