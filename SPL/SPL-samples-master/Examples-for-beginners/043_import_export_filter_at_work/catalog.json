This powerful feature lets the downstream import operators to specify what kind of tuples they want to receive by specifying conditional expressions involving tuple attributes. That lets the Streams runtime to apply content-based filtering at the point of export. Those who need such a feature to control what information should be sent downstream based on the tuple contents can make use of this flexible feature. This can be done on the fly without stopping and restarting the application."}
