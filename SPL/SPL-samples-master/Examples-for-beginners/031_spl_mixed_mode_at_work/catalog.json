In this, developers can mix PERL code islands inside of an SPL application. Mixed-mode enables the easy parameterization of SPL applications. This example gives a slight flavor of how a PERL code snippet inter-mixed with SPL allows us to parameterize the SPL Stream names and the number of output stream definitions for an SPL operator. "}
