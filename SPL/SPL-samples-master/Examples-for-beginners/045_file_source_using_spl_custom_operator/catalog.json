Starting in Streams 3.x, it is possible to create source operators without writing primitive source operators in C++ or Java. Simple source operators can be written using the built-in SPL Custom operator. This will come handy for those who don't want to do an extra layer of C++ or Java code for satisfying simple needs for a source operator. You will see a function of a file source operator being implemented all using SPL code in this example."}
