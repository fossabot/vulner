There is a main composite that in turn uses two other composites. This application shows how the additional composites in different namespaces get included into the main composite via the 'use' directive. It also demonstrates how the additional composites can accept their own operator parameters. It teaches the basics of an important feature that will come handy when big applications need to be componentized. "}
