{"category": ["10", "9"], "description": "This example demonstrates two different features of the Java primitive operator framework. It first shows how operator parameters can be easily processed inside the Java operators via the @Parameter annotations. Then, it shows how multiple input and output ports can be accessed inside the Java operators. As a bonus, it also shows a better approach for on the fly creation of the output tuples made with complex nested types.", "language": ["Java"], "tags": ["nested tuple", "create tuple", "multiple input ports", "java", "java operator", "java operator parameters"], "url": "https://github.com/IBMStreams/samples/tree/master/Examples-for-beginners/088_java_operator_params_and_multiple_input_output_ports", "name": "Java Operator Params And Multiple Input Output Ports"}
