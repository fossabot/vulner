## DSPFilter Bandpass Example

This sample demonstrates how to construct a bandpass filter using the **DSPFilter** operator. The **DSPFilter** operator implements a butterworth filter in order to isolate (or filter out) frequencies in a time series.

This example is explained in detail in the following article: [Bandpass and bandstop filter using the DSPFilter operator](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/bandpass-bandstop-filters-using-dspfilter-operator/)
