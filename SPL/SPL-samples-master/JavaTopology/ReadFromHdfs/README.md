## Read from HDFS using the Java Application API
This sample shows you how to create a Streams Java application (no SPL!) that reads files from HDFS. It uses the Java Application API available in the [streamsx.topology](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.topology) project.

Learn more about this application in this [blogPost on Streamsdev](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/source-operator-read-hdfs-files-java-application-api/)
